		 <h3 class="center-align">Experience</h3>
		 <p class="flow-text">
			 Almost all his life, George grew up in Patterson where he used to drive to his first job 30 minutes and
			 drive to college in 40. He went to school for computer science but was unhappy about the pace he was learning.
			 Instead of continuing with academics he decided to find a job where he could utilize what he picked up and start
			 gaining practical experience. Although his first job in tech consisted of coding in C# and using databases, he
			 always wanted more.
		 </p>
		 <p class="flow-text">
			 After working in a basic tech job for a year George wanted to make another jump in his career. He went back to a
			 bootcamp where, unlike college, still gave him the satisfaction of building things. He now works in a group of three
			 other developers doing freelance work.

		 <h3 class="center-align">Hobbies</h3>
		 <p class="flow-text">
			 Almost anything technology related will geek George out.  Coding, video games, hardware, smart devices and connected
			 home appliances are all things that interest him.  Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to spend most days and nights in front
			 of a computer screen. However, when he gets the chance he also likes to go paintballing during the summer, snowboarding
			 during the winter and playing the guitar when he is stuck at home.
